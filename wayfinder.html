  <h5>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL</h5>
  <p>Created for module in my second year is dedicated to group software
    development. In groups of 6 which included both Software Engineering and
    Computer Science students, we had to produce a prototype for a chosen
    client. Our client was the NHS, specifically Northern General Hospital.
    Their requirements were simple, to produce an application that could direct
    patients around the huge hospital. We had one week to produce this.
    We used an agile development process, Scrum, to manage our time and work
    as a team and chose to create a web application, specifically for mobile
    use. By the end of the week we demonstrated our product to the NHS client
    who was impressed and asked if they could get in contact to use some of our
    ideas to incorporate into their own application.
    Our application relies on QR codes that are placed at doors, staircases and
     lifts around the building.</p>
